		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<div>
			Understanding and tuning the performance of extreme-scale parallel computing systems demands a
			streaming approach due to the computational cost of applying offline algorithms to vast amounts 
			of performance log data. Analyzing large streaming data is challenging because the rate of 
			receiving data and limited time to comprehend data make it difficult for the analysts to 
			sufficiently examine the data without missing important changes or patterns. To support streaming 
			data analysis, we introduce a visual analytic framework comprising of three modules: data 
			management, analysis, and interactive visualization. The data management module collects various 
			computing and communication performance metrics from the monitored system using streaming data 
			processing techniques and feeds the data to the other two modules. The analysis module automatically 
			identifies important changes and patterns at the required latency. In particular, we introduce a set 
			of online and progressive analysis methods for not only controlling the computational costs but also 
			helping analysts better follow the critical aspects of the analysis results. Finally, the interactive
			visualization module provides the analysts with a coherent view of the changes and patterns in the 
			continuously captured performance data. Through a multi-faceted case study on performance analysis of 
			parallel discrete-event simulation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for identifying 
			bottlenecks and locating outliers.
