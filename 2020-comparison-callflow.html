		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<div>
			Optimizing the performance of large-scale parallel codes is critical for
			efficient utilization of computing resources. Code developers often explore
			various execution parameters, such as hardware configurations, system software
			choices, and application parameters, and are interested in detecting and
			understanding bottlenecks in different executions. They often collect
			hierarchical performance profiles represented as call graphs, which combine
			performance metrics with their execution contexts. The crucial task of exploring 
			multiple call graphs together is tedious and challenging because of the many
			structural differences in the execution contexts and significant variability
			in the collected performance metrics (e.g., execution runtime). In this paper,
			we present an enhanced version of CallFlow to support the exploration of 
			ensembles of call graphs using new types of visualizations, analysis, graph 
			operations, and features.  We introduce ensemble-Sankey, a new visual
			design that combines the strengths of resource-flow (Sankey) and box-plot 
			visualization techniques.  Whereas the resource-flow visualization can easily
			and intuitively describe the graphical nature of the call graph, the box 
			plots overlaid on the nodes of Sankey convey the performance variability 
			within the ensemble. Our interactive visual interface provides linked views
			to help explore ensembles of call graphs, e.g., by facilitating the analysis 
			of structural differences, and identifying similar or distinct call graphs.
			We demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our design through case
			studies on large-scale parallel codes.
